# titanic
The Jupyter notebook contains code to predict the survival of passengers of the Titanic, using passenger characteristics. I explore the use of data visualization techniques, as well as techniques for optimizing the hyperparameters of machine learning models. I also explore the use of three machine learning models: xgboost, random forest, and feedforward neural network. Finally, I conduct model stacking by using a soft voting classifier.

The datasets are obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic, and contain information on passengers of the Titanic (e.g. survival, demographic characteristics). The test set does not contain information on passenger survival.
